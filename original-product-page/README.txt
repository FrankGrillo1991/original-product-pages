Original Product Page (Client Starter)
=====================================

This is the intentionally barebones version you were "given" by the client.
Known issues (by design, for practice):

- Fixed-width layout (1000px) -> not responsive
- No <meta name="viewport"> tag
- Large, uncompressed placeholder images (1600x1200)
- Missing alt attributes on images (accessibility issue)
- Minimal semantics (no <article>, <section> roles)
- No search/filter/sort, no interactivity
- Basic styles, no color contrast checks

Your task in the improved version:
- Make it responsive (1/2/4 columns)
- Add accessibility (alt text, headings, roles)
- Compress images & add srcset/sizes
- Add search/filter/sort & a quick-view modal
- Improve typography, spacing, and contrast
- Run Lighthouse + axe and fix issues
